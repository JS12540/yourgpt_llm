1. Access to fetch {url} from Localhost is blocked by CORS policy:
    Why: 
    The error message you're encountering, "has been blocked by CORS policy," indicates that 
    your frontend, running on http://localhost:3000, is trying to make a request to your backend, 
    which is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000, and the browser is blocking the request due to
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy restriction.

    Solution: add the following code
    {
        from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

        app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
        )

    }


2. TimeoutError: [WinError 10060]:
    Why: Usual network hold time 2-3 secs.
    Potential Solution: 
        a. async: run async for more time
        b. host and run model on cloud.
